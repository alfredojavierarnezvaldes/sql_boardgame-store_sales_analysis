# SQL BOARDGAME SALES ANALYSIS PROJECT

## Project Overview
This project simulates a small online boardgame store database and analyzes sales, customers, order and payments using **PostgreSQL**.

The main objective is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Design a relational database
- Write SQL queries from basic to advanced level
- Extract business insights from raw data

---

## Tools & technolgies.
- PostgreSQL
- pgADMIN 4
- SQL (CTEs, joins, aggregations, subqueries)
- Jupyter Notebook (for documentation and analysis)
- GitHub

---

## Database Structure
The database includes the following tables:
- 'categories'
- 'customers'
- 'order_items'
- 'orders'
- 'payments'
- 'products'

Relationships are based on primary and foreign keys

## Analysis & Queries
The analysis includes:
- Basic queriers (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- Agregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- JOINs across multiple tables
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Business-focused questions (revenue, customer behavior, payment methods)
